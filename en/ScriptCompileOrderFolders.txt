!Special Folders and Script Compilation Order

For the most part, you can choose any names you like for the folders in your project but Unity reserves some names to indicate that the contents have a special purpose. Some of these folders have an effect on the order of script compilation. Essentially, there are four separate phases of script compilation and the phase where a script will be compiled is determined by its parent folder.

This is significant in cases where a script must refer to classes defined in other scripts. The basic rule is that anything that will be compiled in a phase ''after'' the current one cannot be referenced. Anything that is compiled in the current phase or an earlier phase is fully available.

Another situation occurs when a script written in one language must refer to a class defined in another language (say, a UnityScript file that declares variables of a class defined in a C# script). The rule here is that the class being referenced must have been compiled in a ''earlier'' phase.

The phases of compilation are as follows:-

__Phase 1:__ Runtime scripts in folders called __Standard Assets__, __Pro Standard Assets__ and __Plugins__.

__Phase 2:__ Editor scripts in folders called __Standard Assets/Editor__, __Pro Standard Assets/Editor__ and __Plugins/Editor__.

__Phase 3:__ All other scripts that are not inside a folder called __Editor__.

__Phase 4:__ All remaining scripts (ie, the ones that ''are'' inside a folder called __Editor__).


Additionally, any script inside a folder called __WebPlayerTemplates__ will not be compiled at all.

A common example is where a UnityScript file needs to reference a class defined in a C# file. You can achieve this by placing the C# file inside a Plugins folder and the UnityScript file in a non-special folder. If you don't do this, you will get an error saying the C# class cannot be found.
